# Bias and Variance

Bias and variance are two key sources of error in any predictive model. Understanding the trade-off between them is crucial for building effective machine learning models.

- Bias refers to errors due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias leads to an underfit model that doesn't capture the underlying patterns in the data well.

- Variance refers to errors due to excessive sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance results in overfitting, where the model captures noise in the training data as if it were a true pattern.

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff
There is typically a tradeoff between bias and variance:

- High bias (low variance): Simple models that donâ€™t overfit but underfit (e.g., linear models).
- High variance (low bias): Complex models that may fit the training data well but generalize poorly (e.g., deep neural networks without regularization).
- Optimal tradeoff: A model that balances bias and variance to minimize the total prediction error.
